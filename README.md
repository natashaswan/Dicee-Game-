# Dicee-Game-
Another project that I created as a part of my full stack web development bootcamp with Angela Yu from the App Brewery. In this project I worked with Math Random and Math Floor methods. Upon refreshing the page, a random number is created and used to pick out a random dice image between dice1.png to dice6.png and placed inside the <img> elements, also the text in the h1 changes to show which user won or if there was a draw depending on the dice values of player 1 (left) and player 2 (right). I developed the app a bit by adding the Roll Again button which refreshes the page upon pressing. 

The styling sheet was provided by Angela.
