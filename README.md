## Description
When the "Roll Again!" button is pressed, the dicee get thrown randomly, so the players 1 and 2 have their own dice values and the website announces a winner depending on whose value is higher. 

In this project I worked with Math Random and Math Floor methods. Upon refreshing the page, a random number is created and used to pick out a random dice image between dice1.png to dice6.png and placed inside the elements. The text in the h1 changes to show which player won or if there was a draw. 


## Technologies used
1. JS
2. HTML
3. CSS
