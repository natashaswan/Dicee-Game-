# Dicee-Game-
Another project that I created as a part of my full stack web development bootcamp with Angela Yu from the App Brewery. In this project I worked with Math Random and Math Floor methods. The random number created was used to pick out a random dice image between dice1.png to dice6.png and placed inside the <img> elements.

The styling sheet was provided by Angela.
